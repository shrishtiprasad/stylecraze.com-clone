        <p class="matter">Before applying cosmetics in the morning, wash your face so that you’ll have the capacity to begin with a crisp canvas. Use a cleanser or simply splash some lukewarm water all over your face to wash away any dead skin on your skin. Pat it dry with a towel.</p>
        <p class="matter">Avoid using hot water to wash your face.</p>
        <h3>2. Apply BB Cream:</h3>

        <p class="matter">Once you apply BB cream, you rescue yourself from all the jazz of applying moisturizer, sunscreen, foundation, and the hassle of brushes and sponges. BB cream instantly covers the spots on your face, and gives you an even and radiant skin.</p>
        <p class="matter">Apply it with your fingertips.</p>
        <p class="matter">TIP: It’s always handy to keep the BB cream in your purse all the times. Along with giving you the light coverage, it also moisturizes the skin.</p>
        <h3>3. Conceal If Required:</h3>

        <p class="matter">If you’re the one blessed with a glowing and fab skin (must admit, we secretly envy you!), then you can skip this step. And for the rest of us, we do have a trick to get that fab skin! A quick swipe of concealer (creamy ones) over the pesky zit or marks is enough to hide them</p>
        <p class="matter">Apply it with your fingers. Reason – the heat of your fingers helps blend the concealer to give a real and natural finish.</p>
        <h3>4. Time To Give Your Cheeks A Rosy Flush:</h3>

        <p class="matter">Now that you’re done with your base, apply a neutral-colored blush on your cheekbones. It will make you look brighter and even more awake!</p>
        <p class="matter">If you’re running out of your desired blusher, you can use lipstick as an alternative!</p>
        <h3>5. Line Your Eyes Softly:</h3>

        <p class="matter">Give some definition to your look by applying a kohl or kajal to your lower lid. For the upper eyelid, use liquid eyeliner or a gel pencil and add some magic to your eyes. Don’t forget to swipe some along your brows to brighten the effect.</p>
        <p class="matter">Finish it off by applying a generous coat of mascara. It will open up your eyes. And Ta-da, you’re done with your eyes!</p>
        <h3>6. Enhance Your Lips:</h3>

        <p class="matter">Make your lips appear fuller by applying a lip liner and moisturize the lips using a lip gloss rather than going with a bright lip color.</p>
        <p class="matter">However, if your makeup feels incomplete without a lip color, add some color to your lips. Outline the lips with lip liner and evenly fill in with lipstick using a brush.</p>
        <p class="matter">Having a lip stain in your bag can turn out to be a smart idea, both for your lips and cheeks!</p>
        <p id="ending">When it comes to office makeup, ensure that the products are gentle on your skin and can maintain a flawless look throughout the day. Avoid purchasing cheap and poor-quality products since you will be applying them regularly. Also, do not forget to wear your confidence like the makeup as that will help you stand out from the crowd.</p>
