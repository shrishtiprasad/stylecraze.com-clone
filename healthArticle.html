            The digestive system is a complex and vital part of your body, and it spans all the way from your mouth to your rectum. It helps your body absorb various essential nutrients and facilitates the excretion of waste.
        </p>

        <h2>Types, Causes, And Symptoms Of Digestive Problems</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Chronic Constipation</h3>
        <p class="matter">This is when your digestive system cannot get rid of the body’s waste for an extended period.</p>
        <p class="matter">It occurs when your colon is unable to pass stools through the remaining of your digestive tract.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Food Intolerance</h3>
        <p class="matter">This happens when your digestive system cannot tolerate certain foods. Unlike food allergies, food intolerance solely affects digestion.</p>
        <p class="matter">A common form of food intolerance is Celiac disease, which also is an autoimmune disorder. It causes digestive problems upon gluten consumption. The causes range from the absence of a particular digestive enzyme in the body to the presence of certain chemicals in food.</p>
        <p class="matter">TIP: It’s always handy to keep the BB cream in your purse all the times. Along with giving you the light coverage, it also moisturizes the skin.</p>
        
        <h3>3. GERD</h3>
        <p class="matter">Frequent heartburn (a digestive problem) can lead to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) that eventually damages your esophagus.</p>
        <p class="matter">Apply it with your fingers. Reason – the heat of your fingers helps blend the concealer to give a real and natural finish.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Inflammatory Bowel Disease</h3>
        <p class="matter">Although the exact cause is unknown, IBD is most often associated with genetics (a family history of the disease) and problems with the immune system.</p>
        <p class="matter">If you’re running out of your desired blusher, you can use lipstick as an alternative!</p>
        
        <h3>5. Line Your Eyes Softly:</h3>
        <p class="matter">Give some definition to your look by applying a kohl or kajal to your lower lid. For the upper eyelid, use liquid eyeliner or a gel pencil and add some magic to your eyes. Don’t forget to swipe some along your brows to brighten the effect.</p>
        <p class="matter">Finish it off by applying a generous coat of mascara. It will open up your eyes. And Ta-da, you’re done with your eyes!</p>
        
        <h3>6. Enhance Your Lips:</h3>
        <p class="matter">Make your lips appear fuller by applying a lip liner and moisturize the lips using a lip gloss rather than going with a bright lip color.</p>
        <p class="matter">However, if your makeup feels incomplete without a lip color, add some color to your lips. Outline the lips with lip liner and evenly fill in with lipstick using a brush.</p>
        <p class="matter">Having a lip stain in your bag can turn out to be a smart idea, both for your lips and cheeks!</p>
        
        <p id="ending">Chronic constipation, GERD, food intolerance, and inflammatory bowel disease are some common digestive problems that present with varied symptoms, but all of these indicate an issue with the digestive system. Home remedies for digestive problems like chamomile tea, apple cider vinegar, peppermint, aloe vera, fennel seeds, black pepper, green tea, and lemon juice can help calm an inflamed and irritated digestive system and improve its functioning. However, if your digestive issues persist or worsen even after following the remedies diligently, you should seek medical attention to check for underlying health concerns. It is important to treat digestive problems as early as possible to avoid further health complications.</p>
